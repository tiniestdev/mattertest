ughhhhh i need to figure out how im gonna replicate everything in backpack cause it sonyl being recognized as a bare storable now but we also need to include tool and corporeal components as well okokokokokokokokokokokokokkokokokokokokkokokokokokokokkkokokokkokokokokokok
ok so we can just make a new archetype right itll be called BACKPACK ARCHETYPE and 

wait hold on all storables are liek expected to have a display right how else are thye gona be stored and seen in a storage ui so we'll just pack all our info inside the storage compononent itll have image info text info everything and then when a player tries to equip it theyre gonna get screwewd ohnonononnonooonononononoononomnnonononn

i think about this alter goodbye slep

every tool, every entity shoudl already be replicated in its entirety before storing em into the backpack
like on creation
